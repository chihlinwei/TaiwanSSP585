\description{
Coefficient variation of the decadal mean seafloor (bottom-most) projections among models.
}
\details{
Yearly mean from 2041 to 2060 were calculated from each models and then the decadal mean was calculated from the yearly mean.
Coefficient variation was calculated from the decadal mean across all models.
