\description{
Emsemble average of the decadal mean seafloor (bottom-most) projections during 2041 to 2060
minus the decadal mean projections during 1950 to 2000.
}
\details{
Climate change (difference of decadal mean) between the period of 1950 to 2000 and the period 2041 to 2080 were calculated
for each models. Emsemble average of climate changes was calculated across all models.
